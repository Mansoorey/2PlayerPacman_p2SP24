# 2PlayerPacman_p2SP24
This is a 2 player pacman game. It contains a starting menu where the high score is displayed and also the options to exit and play. When the user decides to play, he or she will be asked to give usernames for pacman 1 and 2. Then the game will begin. Movement for the two pacmen is aim based meaning you can only control the direction in which they are moving and they will move on their own. Moveover, the ghosts are also free to move in the game. The lives and scores for each pacman is tracked seperately. Each pacman has 3 lives and the lives will decrease when they collide with the ghosts. Each pacman has their own respawn points when they collide with the ghosts. The score increases when the pacman eats pallets and when the pallets are finished on the tiles, they will be replenished and this will also increase the speed of the two pacmen and the ghosts to provide more challenge. When a pacman loses all 3 lives, he will be removed from the screen and when both the pacmen lose all their lives, the option to retry and quit will be available.
